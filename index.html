    <p>When you were introduced to groups, you were probably told that they represent the symmetries of an object. There are a bunch of actions you can take on the shape that leave it looking the same, symmetries, and doing them one after another leads to a special structure called a group.</p>
    <img src="/IntroductionToGroups_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>Later, you were probably told that a group is more generally any set with a binary operation with closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. The group is only defined by its multiplication table; the symbols in it don&#39t necessarily have to have their usual meaning.</p>
    <img src="/GeneralGroupDefinition_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>So can every group be represented by the symmetries of an object? That would be a much more concrete and easier way to visualise the group. This question actually leads straight into representation theory, a way to represent abstract concepts like groups with easier concepts like matrices.</p>
    <p>First, why do the symmetries of an object make a group? The set of symmetries of an object are all of the transformations of space of some type, usually isometries, that leave the object looking the same. The group operation is the result of composing two transformations: doing them one after another. It&#39s important to realise that the elements of the group are movements of the object, not orientations.</p>
    <img src="/CompositionOfTransformations.gif">
    <p>If you do something that makes the object look the same, and then another thing that makes it look the same, it’s going to look the same. Doing them together is a symmetry, too. That’s closure.</p>
    <p>Doing three things to an object is going to do the same thing as doing two things, where one of the things is just doing the first two things. That&#39s associativity.</p>
    <p>If you do something and the action is unchanged, then if you do it in reverse, the object is still unchanged. The reverse is a symmetry, too. That&#39s the inverse.</p>
    <p>And finally, you can do nothing, and nothing happens to the object, so it’s a symmetry. That&#39s identity.</p>
    <p>These kinds of groups are called symmetry groups. Our question is: is any finite group G the symmetry group of some object, say a polytope? The answer is yes, and we can show two different ways to do it.</p>
    <p>We want to map every element of the group to a way to move the object. For the mapping to be useful, we want it to actually describe the structure of the group. That means that the group operation should do the same thing whether applied to the group elements, or their physical realisations. It&#39s a group homomorphism from the group to the group of all transformations of the object.</p>
    <img src="/GroupHomomorphism_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>Second, we want the movements of the object to actually be symmetries of the object. Those two criteria make the object a representation of the group. Or more technically, the subgroup of the general linear group corresponding to the symmetries of the object is a representation of the group, but we won’t worry about that.</p>
    <p>We also want two distinct elements of the group to do different things to the object. Otherwise we can just say that every element of the group is the identity transformation of the object, which isn’t very useful. This makes the representation faithful, and the mapping between the groups an isomorphism. To make the object a perfect representation of the group, there should be no extra symmetries of the object that aren’t accounted for in the group. Otherwise we can just take a sphere of sufficiently high dimension, which isn’t very interesting, and won’t help you to visualise the group.</p>
    <p>So we want to find an object whose symmetry group is isomorphic to the group in question. If the object is too symmetric, we can break some of its symmetries. For instance, we can break some of the symmetries of the square by squishing it into a rhombus. The symmetry group of the rhombus is then a subgroup of that of the square.</p>
    <img src="/BreakingSomeSymmetries_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>You might guess that we can’t describe every possible finite group with just the symmetries of 3-dimensional space. There are some big, complicated groups out there. So we will need to use polytopes of higher dimensions in order to describe more complicated groups. To keep things simple, we should use the n-dimensional object with the simplest symmetries, the n-simplex.</p>
    <p>The symmetry group of a simplex is relatively large. Since all of the vertices are identical, and there are edges going between any two vertices, there is a transformation for any permutation of the vertices. The group of all permutations under composition is called a symmetric group, not to be confused with the symmetry groups from earlier. The symmetry group of a simplex with n vertices is the n-symmetric group.</p>
    <img src="/SymmetriesOfSimplex_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>There is actually a very simple representation of the group using symmetric groups. Cayley’s theorem says that every group is a subgroup of the symmetric group of its elements. In other words, you can destroy some symmetries of some symmetric group to get any group.</p>
    <p>A subset of the n-symmetric group is a set of permutations, where when you compose any two rotations from the set, you get a rotation from the set. In other words, a subset of the symmetric group is what you get if you don’t allow some sorts of permutations, but still keep the group properties.</p>
    <p>The set of permutations you’ll need is actually very simple if you look at the multiplication table of the group. Take a moment to think about how.</p>
    <img src="/MultiplicationTable_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>Notice how each element permutes the other elements of the group. Each element has to be represented exactly once in each row because of the ability to take inverses, so these are permutations. These permutations can actually represent the group. This is how:</p>
    <p>The multiplication operation of the group has to match the composition operation of the permutations. If the first permutation takes c to bc, and the second takes bc to abc, then the total effect is taking c to abc, a multiplication by ab. This means the composition of the permutations corresponding to a and b is the permutation corresponding to ab, so this is a group homomorphism.</p>
    <p>And that's the proof of Cayley's theorem! It is surprisingly simple, tumbling straight out of the multiplication table.</p>
    <p>Now we can apply Cayley’s theorem to construct a polytope with any group G as a symmetry group. Since the symmetry group of the (n-1)-simplex is the n-symmetric group, inspired by Cayley’s theorem, we assign each vertex to an element of the group. Then each element of the group also corresponds to the transformation that permutes the vertices, like they were being multiplied by that element.</p>
    <img src="/ElementVertexRotation_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>Each element a of the group corresponds to the transformation taking the vertex labelled b to the old location of the vertex labelled ab. This is a symmetry of the tetrahedron because all of the vertices and edges are identical. The only problem is that all of the other symmetries of the object are still valid. There are symmetries of the tetrahedron that don’t correspond to any group member. The tetrahedron is still a faithful representation of the group, it just would be nice if it didn’t have any of those extra symmetries. To make the representation better, we need to destroy some of the symmetries of the object.</p>
    <p>A simple way to destroy some of the symmetries of the object is to add some sort of asymmetrical decoration onto one of the vertices, say the one corresponding to the identity element. This makes any transformation that leaves this vertex in a different orientation illegal. A simple decoration is an asymmetrical notch taken out of the vertex, which works in any dimension.</p>
    <img src="/IdentityDecoration_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>We still need to allow the symmetries that take the decorated identity vertex to a different vertex. This means we have to copy this decoration to the other vertices. When we apply all of the transformations, the identity vertex will visit each vertex once, and we copy the decoration in whatever orientation it ends up. The long sides of the notches don’t have to touch each other, it just looks prettier.</p>
    <img src="/CopyingDecoration_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>For instance, the notch on the identity vertex (0) has its long, pointy side pointed towards vertex 3. If we perform transformation 2, the identity vertex goes to vertex 2·0=2. Then we copy the notch onto vertex 2 in the same orientation it goes under transformation 2. Under transformation 2, vertex 3, where the long side of the identity decoration pointed, goes to vertex 2·3=1, so the long side of the notch at vertex 2 has to point at vertex 1.</p>
    <p>Because every vertex now has an asymmetrical decoration, this shape has no symmetries other than the ones corresponding to the elements of the group. However, we might have destroyed some symmetries of the shape which we were supposed to keep. For instance, what if transformation 2 takes 3’s decoration to vertex 1, but in a different orientation than 1’s decoration was? That would invalidate that transformation.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, this is not the case. Remember that each symmetry of the object corresponds to an element of the group, and doing two transformations, one after the other, corresponds to multiplication in the group. 1’s decoration looks like the 0’s decoration under the transformation 1. 3’s decoration looks like 0’s decoration under the transformation 3. Then if we transform 3’s decoration by 2, it will look like 0’s decoration transformed by 3 and then 2. This is the same as the transformation 2·3 (remember that function composition goes right to left). But that’s just transformation 1. So when vertex 3 is sent to vertex 1 under transformation 2, it looks like the old vertex 1. So this is still a valid symmetry.</p>
    <img src="/CompositionOfDecorations_ManimCE_v0.15.2.png">
    <p>This means that every element of the group corresponds to the symmetry of the object that permutes its vertices like the element permutes the other elements of the group under left-multiplication. Also, the object has no other symmetries besides the ones corresponding to the group. Third, doing two symmetries of the object one after another behaves exactly like multiplying their corresponding group elements. This makes our special object a perfect representation of the group.</p>
