    <p>When you were introduced to groups, you were probably told that they represent the symmetries of an object. There are a bunch of actions you can take on the shape that leave it looking the same, symmetries, and doing them one after another leads to a special structure called a group.</p>

    <p>Later, you were probably told that a group is more generally any set with a binary operation with closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. The group is only defined by its multiplication table; the symbols in it don&#39t necessarily have to have their usual meaning.</p>

    <p>So can every group be represented by the symmetries of an object? That would be a much more concrete and easier way to visualise the group. This question actually leads straight into representation theory, a way to represent abstract concepts like groups with easier concepts like matrices.</p>
    <p>First, why do the symmetries of an object make a group? The set of symmetries of an object are all of the transformations of space of some type, usually isometries, that leave the object looking the same. The group operation is the result of composing two transformations: doing them one after another. It&#39s important to realise that the elements of the group are movements of the object, not orientations.</p>

    <p>If you do something that makes the object look the same, and then another thing that makes it look the same, it’s going to look the same. Doing them together is a symmetry, too. That’s closure.</p>
    <p>Doing three things to an object is going to do the same thing as doing two things, where one of the things is just doing the first two things. That&#39s associativity.</p>
    <p>If you do something and the action is unchanged, then if you do it in reverse, the object is still unchanged. The reverse is a symmetry, too. That&#39s the inverse.</p>
    <p>And finally, you can do nothing, and nothing happens to the object, so it’s a symmetry. That&#39s identity.</p>
    <p>These kinds of groups are called symmetry groups. Our question is: is any finite group G the symmetry group of some object, say a polytope? The answer is yes, and we can show two different ways to do it.</p>
    <p>We want to map every element of the group to a way to move the object. For the mapping to be useful, we want it to actually describe the structure of the group. That means that the group operation should do the same thing whether applied to the group elements, or their physical realisations. It&#39s a group homomorphism from the group to the group of all transformations of the object.</p>

    <p>Second, we want the movements of the object to actually be symmetries of the object. Those two criteria make the object a representation of the group. Or more technically, the subgroup of the general linear group corresponding to the symmetries of the object is a representation of the group, but we won’t worry about that.</p>
    <p>We also want two distinct elements of the group to do different things to the object. Otherwise we can just say that every element of the group is the identity transformation of the object, which isn’t very useful. This makes the representation faithful, and the mapping between the groups an isomorphism. To make the object a perfect representation of the group, there should be no extra symmetries of the object that aren’t accounted for in the group. Otherwise we can just take a sphere of sufficiently high dimension, which isn’t very interesting, and won’t help you to visualise the group.</p>
    <p>So we want to find an object whose symmetry group is isomorphic to the group in question. If the object is too symmetric, we can break some of its symmetries. For instance, we can break some of the symmetries of the square by squishing it into a rhombus. The symmetry group of the rhombus is then a subgroup of that of the square.</p>

    <p>You might guess that we can’t describe every possible finite group with just the symmetries of 3-dimensional space. There are some big, complicated groups out there. So we will need to use polytopes of higher dimensions in order to describe more complicated groups. To keep things simple, we should use the n-dimensional object with the simplest symmetries, the n-simplex.</p>
    <p>The symmetry group of a simplex is relatively large. Since all of the vertices are identical, and there are edges going between any two vertices, there is a transformation for any permutation of the vertices. The group of all permutations under composition is called a symmetric group, not to be confused with the symmetry groups from earlier. The symmetry group of a simplex with n vertices is the n-symmetric group.</p>
